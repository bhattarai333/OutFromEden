# OutFromEden
First attempt at creating a computer game. Art by Jonathan Mertz, music by Melanie Meredith. Managed to create physics including gravity,
acceleration, physics, collisions, and jumping. Enemies were created as well as ai to control enemy movement. NPCs were implemented with
dialogue. Parallax and screen following were implemented. Game eventually abandoned due to spaghetti code and collision errors.
